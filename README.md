# recurrent-neural-network

* Recurrent Neural Network for Bitcoin Price Prediction | Principles of Computational Intelligence
  * Trained RNN with stochastic gradient descent optimizer algorithm & mean squared error as loss value for BTC-USD price prediction
  * Utilized Python, TensorFlow (Keras) for model build & train, scikit-learn for raw data preprocessing, GRU layers, Dropout layers to avoid overfitting, Jupyter notebook & matplotlib for plotting, NumPy for calculations, Pandas for data manipulation, BTC-USD historical daily dataset for training & evaluation

Predicted Price:
